This repository helps in performing time series prediction on Road Dataset.

## What is time series?

In mathematics, a time series is a series of data points indexed (or listed or graphed) in time order. Most commonly, a time series is a sequence taken at successive equally spaced points in time. Thus it is a sequence of discrete-time data. Time series analysis comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data.

## Objective : 

To perform predictions of Parameter 9-13 from the given dataset for every Section.

## Methodology Used : 

Transformed the Data into Train and Test Dataset, by extracting 10th year data for parameter 9-13 for every section.
Applied Extra Regressor Model to implement random forest and predicted the values.
